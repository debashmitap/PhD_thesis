The \textit{influence maximization (IM)} problem is a discrete optimization problem [Kempe et al.~\cite{Kempe2003}] of selecting the $k$ most influential nodes in a network, and has ample applications ranging from viral marketing to outbreak detection. The IM problem is as follows: given a budget $k$ and a graph $G$, our goal is to find a seed set $S$ consisting of $k$ nodes of $G$ which maximizes the expected number of nodes influenced by $S$, according to some model of influence diffusion. The classic IM problem, which is also referred to as the \textit{non-adaptive IM}, selects the seed set $S$ before starting the diffusion process. Therefore, the focus is on the efficiency of the solution.

A few years later, Golovin and Krause~\cite{Golovin2011a} introduced the \textit{adaptive IM (AIM)} to target the efficacy of the problem. In the adaptive setting, selection of the $k$ seed nodes occurs one at a time, such that the $j$-th seed node is selected after observing the actual influence from the previously selected $j-1$ seeds. There are two main feedback models that have been studied: \textit{full-adoption}, where the entire diffusion carried out by a seed node in the previous step is observed, and \textit{myopic}, where only the neighbours of the previously selected seed nodes are considered as a feedback.

While adaptive policies are strictly stronger than non-adaptive ones, the latter are much easier to design and implement. Golovin and Krause~\cite{Golovin2011a} proposed a measure called the \textit{adaptivity gap (AG)}, which is the ratio between the adaptive and non-adaptive optima. If the AG is small, we say that the non-adaptive policy provides a good approximation of the adaptive optimum.

In this thesis, we study AG with both feedback models. Under the full adoption feedback, we investigate the upper bound of AG over several graph classes, from in-arborescences to general graphs. We show the first sub-linear upper bound on AG that holds for any graph. 
Next, we have the experimental part, where we take different network models, such as random, scale-free and real world networks, and draw several comparisons between the adaptive greedy and the non-adaptive greedy algorithms under various network settings and parameters.

Eventually, we move on to the myopic feedback model, which lacks the property of submodularity. To recover from the drawbacks of being non-submodular, an artificial diffusion process is taken into account. We introduce a new technique to bound the AG without using the commonly used approaches, such as multi-linear extensions or random walks. We also study the adaptive greedy algorithm under the new setting and compare it to optimal adaptive policy. Our approach is of independent interest and can be used for further studies related to  different adaptive optimization problems.

I thank my supervisors for being a positive influence in both academia and my life in particular. Prof. Gianlorenzo D'Angelo, for being a patient and kind person. Gianlorenzo's pursuit of high standards in research have deeply shaped and impressed me over the years. He has invariably given me feedback on my work in the most benevolent way as possible. 
Dr. Cosimo Vinci as a forbearing supervisor, for consistently teaching and answering my questions without a speck of annoyance on his face. His unlimited enthusiasm in every aspect has motivated me to stick to this PhD during the bleaker times. Gianlorenzo and Cosimo always checked on my overall health before talking about work, and I am grateful for that.

My parents, for always letting me follow my dreams and being the pillars of strength. \textit{Baba}, you really made me a strong and independent woman to deal with the world through your unusual ways. \textit{Ma}, thank you for educating me to look beyond the appearance and have empathy.

My grandparents, who were amazing, and loved me till their last breath. I give them most of the credits for making me a good human being. There were times when I had to question my moral and their teachings reminded me of who I am. I miss them both, even though I don't talk about it often.

Pritom and Saili for being my only strand of family in Europe. I have spent most of the Christmas holidays in the course of my PhD with them, eating the delectable food Saili made for us. Thank you, brother, for always keeping me entertained, during the stressful periods.

Théo, for truly being my best friend and always believing in me with complete honesty. You have been an incredibly supportive and dedicated \textit{ami} during the last seven and a half years I have known you. \textit{Merci}!

A handful of people at the GSSI whom I call my adulting friends. These people have taken up the baton to teach me a lot of valuable life lessons. My heartfelt thanks to the entire GSSI community and the CS department for doing what they do the best.

Last but not the least, \textit{grazie mille} to the \textit{bella città} of L'Aquila, and the nice people I have encountered during these four years. Waking up to the beautiful view of the mountains definitely did good to my soul and helped me endure the shortcomings. Also, there is no better place than L'Aquila to learn about the Italian bureaucracy. This has been my second challenge, other than research, and there remains to be a lot of open problems which has been verified by many in the same boat as me.
